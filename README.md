# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
# Jupyter Notebooks_Hands-On Practical Exercises

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I created during my **Data Science Professional Certificate**. 

Throughout the course, I developed hands-on skills in Data Science and Machine Learning, covering the following key areas:

- **Data Science Methodology**: I started with an orientation to Data Science, learning about the processes and methods used in the field.
- **Tools**: I became familiar with various data science tools and used them throughout the course to perform tasks such as data manipulation and analysis.
- **Python and SQL**: I developed proficiency in Python and SQL, using them for data manipulation, querying, and analysis.
- **Data Visualization and Analysis**: I worked on several data visualization and analysis tasks to gain insights from data.
- **Machine Learning**: I created and evaluated multiple Machine Learning models to predict outcomes and uncover patterns in the data.

In addition to completing several labs and assignments on the cloud, I culminated my learning with a **Capstone Project** where I applied the skills and knowledge gained throughout the course to solve a real-world problem.

Feel free to explore the individual projects to see my approach and learnings from this course.
